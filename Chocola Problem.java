// We are given a bar of chocolate composed of mn square pieces. One should break the chocolate into single squares. Each break of a part of the chocolate is charged a cost expressed by a positive integer. 
// This cost does not depend on the size of the part that is being broken but only depends on the line the break goes along. 
// Let us denote the costs of breaking along consecutive vertical lines with x1, Ã—2, ..., xm-1 and along horizontal lines with y1, y2, .., yn-1.
// Compute the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate into single squares.
