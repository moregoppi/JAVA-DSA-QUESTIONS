// Given an array arr[ ] of size N having elements, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.
// Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element.
// If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. For example, next greater of the last element is always -1.

// Example 1:

// Input: 
// N = 4, arr[] = [1 3 2 4]
// Output:
// 3 4 4 -1
// Explanation:
// In the array, the next larger element 
// to 1 is 3 , 3 is 4 , 2 is 4 and for 4 ? 
// since it doesn't exist, it is -1.
// Example 2:

// Input: 
// N = 5, arr[] [6 8 0 1 3]
// Output:
// 8 -1 1 3 -1
// Explanation:
// In the array, the next larger element to 
// 6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements 
// hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 , for 1 it 
// is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger 
// element on right and hence -1.
// Your Task:
// This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function nextLargerElement() that takes list of integers arr[ ] and N as input parameters and returns list of integers of length N denoting the next greater elements for all the corresponding elements in the input array.

// Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
// Expected Auxiliary Space : O(N)

// Constraints:
// 1 ≤ N ≤ 106
// 0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1018

                ans[stack.pop()] = arr[i];
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
